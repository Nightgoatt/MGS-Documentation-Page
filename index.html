          Introduction
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>After threatening to launch a nuclear strike with the American-developed Metal Gear REX, the Sons of Big
            Boss
            demanded that the U.S. Government hand over the remains of Big Boss and $1 billion dollars, issuing a
            deadline
            of 24 hours. The Genome Soldiers of the NGSF had been subject to advanced gene therapy, involving the use of
            Big Boss's "soldier genes" to enhance their combat skills and senses. Big Boss's DNA was considered to be a
            highly secretive and sensitive project and the U.S. government could not allow this information to be
            revealed
            to the public due to the controversial nature of the genetic enhancement of soldiers. The DNA was also
            considered a priceless treasure to the U.S. military, and the government could not allow it to fall into the
            wrong hands.</p>

          <p>By the request of Defense Secretary Jim Houseman, FOXHOUND's former commander Roy Campbell enlisted Solid
            Snake to help thwart the terrorist threat. Sending armed soldiers to Snake's retreat in Twin Lakes, he was
            later brought aboard the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Discovery, in the Bering Sea. Forced to strip down
            to his underwear, a reluctant Snake was briefed on the situation by Campbell, while FOXHOUND's medical chief
            Naomi Hunter injected him with nanomachines.</p>

          <p>With only 19 hours remaining until the terrorists' deadline,[1] Campbell successfully convinced Snake of
            the
            gravity of the situation as the Discovery approached Shadow Moses, also admitting that his own participation
            in the mission was because his niece, rookie soldier Meryl Silverburgh, was among the hostages. Persuaded to
            infiltrate Shadow Moses in a solo covert operation, Snake's objectives were to rescue DARPA Chief Donald
            Anderson and ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker, learn the terrorists' nuclear launch capabilities, and
            prevent
            them from carrying out their threat, for which he would receive radio support from military analyst Nastasha
            Romanenko. Snake agreed to the task under the conditions that he only take orders directly from Campbell,
            and
            that Campbell provide full disclosure regarding the details of the mission.

        <article>
          <p>On February 28, 22:, the Discovery approached Shadow Moses, and Snake began his infiltration. The military
            had Snake make an underwater insertion via an SDV (Swimmer Delivery Vehicle), to avoid the Discovery being
            detected by enemy sonar, which along with the weather conditions, negated the possibility of an air
            insertion.
            Two F-16 fighters were scrambled from Galena AFB as a diversionary tactic, allowing Snake to sneak in
            undetected. Snake reported his successful infiltration to Campbell and Naomi by radio, and was introduced to
            data analyst Mei Ling, who explained the operation of his Soliton Radar.</p>

          <p>Snake later witnessed the terrorist leader, Liquid, board and take off in a Hind D gunship, causing he and
            Campbell to ponder over the presence of Russian weapons on the base. Infiltrating the base's tank hangar via
            the air ducts, Snake was contacted by his former mentor, Master Miller, who had volunteered to offer radio
            support after learning of the mission from Campbell. Snake then eavesdropped on a conversation between two
            Genome Soldiers where he learned that the DARPA Chief had been relocated. Meanwhile, Liquid Snake used the
            Hind D to engage and shoot down the two F-16s.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Making his way deeper into the base, Snake located the prison cells where DARPA Chief Donald Anderson was
            being held. Anderson informed Snake that the terrorists indeed had the ability to launch a nuclear strike
            thanks to Metal Gear REX, the existence of which shocked Snake. Anderson also explained that the terrorists
            needed two detonation codes to arm REX: one from himself, which the terrorists already had, and one from
            Kenneth Baker. Fortunately for Snake, there was a PAL system that he could use to deactivate REX, via three
            card keys. Before Snake could escort the DARPA Chief to safety, Anderson suffered a heart attack and fell
            dead.</p>

          <p>After reporting to Campbell, Snake became suspicious that he knew more than he was letting on, but was
            unable
            to learn more. Hearing the commotion from the next cell, Meryl Silverburgh effected her own escape, tricking
            the guard on patrol and stealing his uniform. As Snake made his way outside, he ran into the disguised
            Meryl,
            who held him at gunpoint. Following a tense showdown, they were soon ambushed by a squad of heavily armed
            Genome Soldiers, and the two joined forces to defeat them. After the coast was clear, Meryl ran into an
            elevator, shooting at Snake after falling under the influence of FOXHOUND's psychic, Psycho Mantis.</p>

          <p>Snake, using information given to him by Anderson, then headed to the lower levels to find President Baker.
            Upon spotting Baker tied to a pillar rigged with C4, Snake feared he had arrived too late before being
            confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot. The two had a gun duel, before the intervention of the Cyborg
            Ninja who cut off Ocelot's hand, as well as cutting the wires holding Baker, the latter also recognizing the
            Ninja upon seeing it. The Ninja then vanished and Ocelot ran off, carrying his severed hand. Snake helped
            Baker, who mentioned that Meryl had the PAL override keys.</p>

          <p>He gave Snake a hint to where to find her Codec frequency. After he gave Snake the REX launch data, and
            telling him where to find Dr. Hal Emmerich, Baker revealed that he had been colluding with the DARPA Chief,
            Donald Anderson to secretly develop a new Metal Gear on the government's so-called black budget. For several
            years, regular payments in the tens of thousands of dollars had been made to the corporate account of a
            dummy
            company for which Anderson's wife ostensibly acted as a consultant.</p>

          <p>After supplying Snake with an optical disc containing all the information on the Metal Gear project
            remaining
            (as the hard drive was shot up during the revolt), Baker was then questioned about his knowledge on the
            Ninja.
            Baker then told him that the Ninja was "FOXHOUND's dirty secret," before imploring Snake to stop Metal
            Gear's
            launch, as his company would be finished if its development were leaked. Snake, surprised at his statement,
            asked Baker if Metal Gear used currently-existing technology.</p>

          <p>Baker confirmed that the Metal Gear unit itself carried currently existing technology, but was unable to
            elaborate more: Baker began to suffer from a heart attack, eerily similar to the way in which Anderson died.
            Baker then rambled on about how the Pentagon had double-crossed him, before eventually dying. Snake then
            contacted Meryl and she opened the hangar's cargo doors for him, allowing him to advance north and find Dr.
            Emmerich.</p>

          <p>On his way there, Snake got a call from an anonymous tipster calling himself "Deepthroat" saying that he
            was
            "one of his fans." He warned Snake of claymore mines that had been planted nearby and that an M1 tank was
            waiting for him up ahead. Sure enough, he was confronted by the tank, commanded by Vulcan Raven and crewed
            by
            two Genome Soldiers. Snake put the tank out of commission by throwing grenades into the hatch after
            distracting its electronic sensors with a chaff grenade.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Entering into Dr. Emmerich's office, the Cyborg Ninja appeared once again and confronted Snake. Confused as
            to how the Ninja seemed to remember him, and finding his fighting style familiar, Snake defeated the Ninja,
            before he vanished again. Snake realized the Ninja was Gray Fox, his old war buddy whom he had killed in
            Zanzibar Land.</p>

          <p>Snake later revealed his discovery to Campbell, who was initially in disbelief until Naomi confirmed this
            as the truth. She explained that Gray Fox had been used for gene therapy experiments, led by FOXHOUND's
            former chief of medical staff Dr. Clark, who had died in a lab explosion two years prior. Campbell had been
            unaware of this, as it had happened shortly after his retirement from the unit; Naomi only knew about it
            because she had stumbled upon it when she joined FOXHOUND.</p>

          <p>She added that Dr. Clark had recovered the body of a soldier after the fall of Zanzibar Land, and revived
            him. He had then been outfitted with a prototype exoskeleton, treated with drugs, and experimented upon for
            four years, leading to the creation of the Genome Soldiers. Campbell was sickened by this, while Snake asked
            Naomi as to why she had failed to tell them sooner.</p>

          <p>She claimed that it was confidential information, but Snake suspected that there was more to it than she
            was letting on. When asked by Campbell as to what happened to Gray Fox afterwards, Naomi stated that he had
            died in the same lab explosion that killed Dr. Clark, at least according to reports. The Ninja's behavior
            led Snake to speculate that Gray Fox didn't even know his own identity, and that the only reason that he had
            lived on was for a fight to the death with Snake.</p>

          <p>Rescuing Dr. Emmerich, who informed Snake he had developed Metal Gear REX, with no knowledge that it was to
            be nuclear-equipped. He believed that REX was intended for provide Theater Missile Defense against nuclear
            weapons. Dr. Emmerich informed Snake that REX's armament was handled by a separate department (in order to
            keep him in the dark) and that REX's rail gun (based on the rail gun for the SDI) was miniaturized for REX
            by a joint venture between ArmsTech and Livermore National Labs. Livermore Labs also developed an
            experimental nuclear weapon for REX. Finally, Emmerich warned Snake that if the PAL override keys didn't
            work, he would have no choice but to destroy REX. Snake also briefly expressed some concern for Dr.
            Emmerich, due to his experience of Anderson and Baker dying from a heart attack shortly after telling him
            everything they knew.</p>

          <p>Snake tracked down Meryl, but she only had one of the three detonation override keys on her. Heading to the
            REX hangar by way of the Communication Towers, Psycho Mantis took control of Meryl using his psychic powers.
            Snake had to knock Meryl out in order to save her. Snake proceeded to defeat Mantis who read both their
            minds, mentioning that he and Snake had a shared suffering, and predicting a great turmoil that awaited him
            and Meryl.</p>

          <p>On their way to the towers, Sniper Wolf shot Meryl and used her as bait to lure Snake out. Devastated,
            Snake headed back to the armory to get a PSG1 in order to battle Wolf. Finding one, he immediately headed
            back and managed to out-snipe Wolf. Snake was then captured and tortured by Ocelot who took the launch data
            Baker gave to Snake. Snake resisted the torture, knowing that if he gave in, Ocelot would kill Meryl.</p>

          <p>In the cell, Snake encountered Anderson's corpse, but mysteriously it appeared he had been dead for days.
            He received a call from Naomi and Campbell and Snake learned more about the situation and a heated
            conversation between Campbell and Snake ensued. Snake realized that Campbell had hid information from him
            and that he knew that REX was a nuclear delivery system. According to Campbell, even the U.S. President had
            apparently been unaware of the existence of REX until the day before. To make matters more complicated, he
            was due to meet with the Russian President the following day for the formal signing of START III.</p>

          <p>If the fact that a new nuclear weapon was being developed by the United States were made public, there was
            a significant chance that the signing would never take place. Worse still, the loss of confidence in
            America's commitment to non-proliferation could create international turmoil. The government clearly had
            every reason to keep the situation under wraps, and there were ample indication that the terrorists had
            counted on the fact. The timing of this takeover as well as the twenty-four hour deadline said as much. And
            Naomi told Snake that the reason that U.S. Government couldn't hand over Big Boss' corpse to the terrorists
            is because the President passed a number of policies that severely restrict genetic engineering on humans
            and he couldn't afford to have the public know about the military's use of genetically-enhanced soldiers.
          </p>

          <p>Eventually Otacon, using his stealth camouflage, helped Snake by giving him rations and ketchup. Thinking
            on his feet, Snake used the ketchup as fake blood and Johnny Sasaki, who was guarding him, foolishly opened
            the cell door to check on him, and Snake immediately capitalized on this opportunity. Knocking Johnny out,
            Snake escaped from the cell, heading back to the Communication Towers.</p>

          Hind D
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>Once atop the first tower, he encountered Liquid who was piloting the Hind D, who proceeded to shoot the
            bridge connecting to the second tower. Using a rope he found, Snake rappelled down to the lower bridge
            connecting to second tower. He met Otacon who attempted to fix the elevator while Snake headed back out to
            fight against Liquid in the Hind D. Snake shot down the Hind with stinger missiles, remarking that the
            explosion should take care of Liquid's cremation, and headed out the tower. Along the way, Otacon mentioned
            that the elevator started operating again, and he didn't even fix it.</p>

          <p>Snake boarded the elevator when Otacon called him again, realizing he forgot to tell Snake something he
            felt was important. There were five prototype stealth camouflage suits in his lab, counting his own. He was
            intending to get one for Snake, but when he went back to the lab, they were gone. He began to suspect that
            someone was "holding" the elevator down. Snake, slowly realizing what had happened, asked Otacon if the
            weight limit warning went off while he was on it. Otacon confirmed this, also finding it strange as he was
            nowhere near being over the weight limit. Snake asked him his weight, Otacon replying that he's 135 pounds,
            and the elevator's maximum limit is 650 pounds. Snake concluded that about five people would be required to
            go over the limit. Otacon realizing what had happened, attempted to warn Snake that whoever stole the
            remaining stealth camouflage prototypes were on the elevator with him. They then ambushed Snake at that
            moment, but Snake managed to defeat them.</p>

          <p>Emerging onto the snowfield, he was caught off guard by Sniper Wolf but he defeated her in the end. She
            told him about growing up and being taken away from the battlefield by a man named Saladin, who Snake
            correctly assumed was Big Boss. Now at peace, she requested Snake to "finish her quick." At that moment,
            Otacon turned up, admitting that he had fallen in love with her. Snake then shot Wolf before him and Otacon
            parted ways. Otacon promised that he would help Snake anyway he could.</p>

          <p>Snake then headed to the control room where REX was being held and in the process met Vulcan Raven for the
            second time. Raven, armed with a gatling gun battled Snake and was eventually defeated. Raven revealed to
            him that the man he met in the cells who told him about Metal Gear was in fact, Decoy Octopus in disguise.
            Snake was then told by Master Miller that Naomi was not who she was making herself out to be. Based on
            information she gave earlier about her past, Miller made the deduction that she was lying and was most
            likely a spy. Snake mentioned that she did used to work for FOXHOUND, and Campbell then asked if she was
            involved in the uprising.</p>

          <p>Miller then hinted that she may actually be part of a third party, before telling Campbell to arrest Naomi,
            as she had endangered the operation. Miller then told Campbell that she needed to be interrogated to find
            out her employers, with Campbell worrying that they would be in big trouble if she turned out to be a spy.
            Snake then asked Campbell what he meant by that, to which Campbell quickly denied any meaning. Miller then
            asked Campbell if he was hiding anything that dealt with the mysterious circumstances on the deaths of the
            DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech President. He then tried to reason with Miller to allow her to stay on the
            mission a little while longer, to which he accidentally let slip to Snake that he may have had some
            involvement in their deaths, with Snake remarking that he wouldn't give Campbell any more time.</p>

          <p>Making his way to the REX Hangar Control Room, Otacon contacted Snake and, after stating that he had
            overheard some guards talking about how REX's preparations were complete, revealed that he was in the
            computer room and thus could hack into President Baker's files to find the PAL key. He eventually contacted
            Snake after successfully hacking into Baker's computer files and stated that, although he hadn't found the
            PAL key file yet, he found out about what Metal Gear REX was capable of: Metal Gear REX was able to launch
            specifically-designed nuclear warheads with its rail gun, and in fact the missiles it launched were stealth
            missiles, due to not requiring any fuel as well as being imbued with stealth technology and a
            surface-piercing warhead, thus making it more apparent why the Sons of Big Boss would choose the START III
            signing date as their deadline: its development being exposed would, in the worse case scenario, result in
            the UN denouncing the United States and possibly even result in the President being brought down.</p>

          <p>Otacon also revealed that it was only simulated and thus never actually tested, explaining the exercise,
            and Otacon's analysis indicated that it accomplished more than they had hoped for, although he couldn't find
            the test data to back it up, with Snake grimly admitting that Baker gave him the test data, and that Ocelot
            took it from him during the torture. Otacon later contacted him telling him about the reason behind Baker's
            motives: ArmsTech was in a worse financial state than even Otacon thought, as there were rumors about a
            hostile takeover against ArmsTech after their X Plane project was scrapped by the military in addition to
            the funding cut caused by SDI, and that REX was their last chance at the company's survival, with Baker
            bribing the DARPA Chief to work on it. Snake overheard Liquid and Ocelot talking about their plans: instead
            of taking the superpowers head on (such as by launching a nuke against the United States or Russia), they
            would provoke the superpowers into fighting against each other, which would possibly result in mutual
            assured destruction.</p>

          <p>This was the reason why he went against Ocelot's suggestion to set the target for the nuclear strike to be
            Chernoton, Russia; preferring instead Lop Nor, China, the location of a nuclear test site. Firing a nuke on
            civilian territory would spell the end for any possible future negotiations, but an attack on a nuclear test
            site could still be concealed from the public by the Chinese government. This way, he could pit the Chinese
            (and also India, due to the CNTBT) against the U.S., and the latter would be forced to confess to some of
            its state secrets. At that point, he figured the other superpowers in the world would be interested in
            buying the system from them (Metal Gear REX and possibly improved Genome Soldiers), at which point he would
            sell them to the highest bidder.</p>

          <p>They also mention that they have included more demands for the White House: one billion dollars, which,
            along with Big Boss' DNA, would be used to cure the Genome Soldiers from a mysterious genetic illness, and
            the FOXDIE vaccine. Not only that, but with Metal Gear REX in his possession, Liquid planned to join his
            forces (FOXHOUND and the Genome Army) with Sergei Gurlukovich's forces and turn Shadow Moses into Outer
            Heaven.</p>

          <p>With these vast resources at his command, Liquid would drag the world into the Third World War, wanting to
            fulfill Big Boss' dream of a world which always had a place for soldiers. Otacon contacted Snake, telling
            Snake he finally found the PAL key file and discovered that the trick to the PAL key was that it was made of
            a shape memory alloy that changed at different temperatures: room temperature, low temperature and high
            temperature.</p>

          <p>Just then, Snake was discovered by Ocelot. Snake lost track of the PAL key after Ocelot shot it out of his
            hand. Snake was able to find the PAL key in the drainage ditch before being poisoned from the radiation.
            After having been taken into custody by Campbell, Naomi called Snake and told him that she was, in fact, a
            spy.</p>

          <p>She then went on to tell Snake why she did what she did, revealing that her brother was Frank Jaeger
            (better known as Gray Fox), which shocked Snake. He had adopted her in Rhodesia after her parents were
            killed. She had simply bought her identity of Naomi Hunter, and didn't even know her real name. It was after
            the Rhodesian Civil War that Big Boss had brought Frank and Naomi over to America, just before Big Boss and
            Frank went off again, to fight in the Mercenary War where Frank was nearly killed by Snake. Filled with pure
            hatred for Snake, Naomi joined FOXHOUND and waited for her time. She revealed to Snake that he had been
            injected with FOXDIE, an artificial virus that targeted specific people and caused the victim to suffer a
            heart attack. He had been injected with it so it could be used to kill off FOXHOUND and Baker, but Naomi had
            re-engineered the virus so that it would kill him too.</p>

          <p>However, she admitted that she no longer hated him, after learning his point of view on the fight with Gray
            Fox. She also told him that while she did hate him for crippling her brother (and thus indirectly putting
            him in gene therapy as a guinea pig), her hatred wasn't the primary reason why she injected him. Just before
            she could reveal the truth, Campbell wrestled her down and told Snake that he was forbidden to talk to her,
            but Snake was deeply upset at Campbell due to him being "betrayed and used."</p>

          <p>Eventually, Snake inputted all the three PAL keys, only to discover that he had inadvertently activated
            Metal Gear REX himself. Confused by how this could have happened, Snake was soon contacted by Miller. He
            revealed to Snake that Anderson's and Baker's detonation codes had never been used as the terrorists had
            been unable to obtain the former's before his death. He also revealed that Octopus had posed as Anderson to
            trick Snake into locating the PAL keys, but FOXHOUND hadn't anticipated that Snake would be a carrier for
            FOXDIE.</p>

          <p>Just then, Campbell called Snake and told him that the person he was talking to wasn't Miller. He told him
            that the real Miller had been dead for three days which shocked Snake. In addition, although Campbell
            initially didn't know about Miller's death due to Miller's Codec being cut off from Campbell, Mei Ling had
            traced "Miller's" frequency from being within Shadow Moses. After the truth came out, Miller revealed that
            he was actually Liquid in disguise.</p>

          <p>Liquid trapped Snake in the control room and activated the soman gas valves, but Snake was able to easily
            escape after calling Otacon for help. After escaping, Snake finally confronted Liquid, face-to-face, and
            Liquid explained that he disguised himself as Miller in order to trick Snake more easily, and also revealed
            how the people who were using him as a disease vector were the people who recruited him: the Pentagon. Naomi
            was working with the Pentagon on making the virus program, although they did not anticipate that she would
            modify FOXDIE to target Snake out of revenge. He also explained that the reason the Pentagon decided to
            inject Snake with FOXDIE was so they could recover the Genome Soldier bodies as well as the Metal Gear REX
            weapon undamaged.</p>

          <p>After explaining this to Snake, as well as briefly stating that he and Snake were not ordinary twins, but
            twins that were clones of Big Boss as a result of the Les Enfants Terribles project, as well as expressing
            his hatred for both Snake for receiving the dominant genes (making Snake "the dominant one"), and their
            father, Big Boss for apparently choosing Liquid knowingly to be the inferior one. Liquid told Snake that he
            wanted to kill Big Boss and exact revenge, berating his brother for "stealing that chance", as well as
            saying that by following Big Boss' legacy, he would "surpass and destroy Big Boss."</p>

          <p>Liquid then climbed aboard REX, giving Snake no option but to destroy it. In addition, he also learned from
            Roy Campbell that if Snake failed to destroy REX, Campbell will be forced to resort to using the USS
            Discovery to bombard the Shadow Moses facility with nuclear warheads as a last resort. Otacon then called
            Snake and told him REX's weakness: REX's radome was Liquid's only view of the outside world while he was
            piloting it under the nigh-indestructible hull of the Metal Gear, meaning that he needed to destroy the
            radome to force Liquid to open up the cockpit and thus expose himself to enemy fire. Despite his valiant
            effort, it seemed like Snake was getting nowhere against REX.</p>

          <p>At that point, Gray Fox jumped out from the shadows and damaged REX's radome, which temporarily blinded
            Liquid. Fox and Snake used this opportunity to hide, which allowed Fox to explain to Snake that he adopted
            Naomi because he killed her parents, and felt guilty because of it. Fox then attempted to take out REX, but
            was eventually crushed under by it, although not before completely destroying REX's radome which forced
            Liquid to open up the cockpit and expose himself. With Liquid now being forced to leave REX's cockpit open
            and expose himself, Snake shot REX several times with the stinger before REX exploded, knocking Snake
            unconscious.</p>

          <p>Snake, hands bound, awoke atop the destroyed REX with Liquid watching over him, the latter having survived
            REX's destruction. Liquid proceeded to explain his plans to Snake, of creating a war-torn world in which
            warriors such as the two of them would always have a place, similar to Big Boss' dream. He also accused
            Snake himself of longing for such a world, despite his protests, citing his actions on Shadow Moses.</p>

          <p>Liquid went on to reveal the existence of "Les Enfants Terribles" to Snake, a project in which the two of
            them were created: they were both clones of Big Boss, with Liquid Snake having supposedly inherited Big
            Boss' "inferior" recessive traits, while Solid Snake inherited his "superior" dominant traits. The Genome
            Soldiers were also products of Big Boss' genes, though their gene therapy had resulted in the appearance of
            a certain genetic disease, for which they needed Big Boss' DNA to cure them. Liquid then revealed his belief
            that he was obeying the "will" of his genes, so that eventually he would surpass Big Boss and his own
            heritage, and that he would kill Snake in order to do so.</p>

          <p>Liquid then directed Snake's attention behind him, to the prone body of Meryl, whom he had also placed atop
            REX. Although Liquid was unsure as to whether she was still alive, he told Snake that he would release her
            as soon as they both finished their business. Informing Snake that they were just about "out of time,"
            Liquid relayed intel that the Pentagon had likely learned of Naomi's betrayal and REX's destruction, and
            were about to destroy the Shadow Moses facility.</p>

          <p>Apparently, Naomi's manipulation of the FOXDIE virus (casting grave doubts on the reliability of FOXDIE
            itself) and the destruction of REX (thus ending the nuclear threat) had put the Pentagon on alert. This was
            shortly confirmed by Campbell, who explained that a nuclear strike (from a payload of surface-piercing
            B61-13 tactical nuclear missiles) was on its way, though he intended to delay the launch in order to buy
            Snake and Meryl some time to escape. Campbell revealed that the Pentagon had deliberately and knowingly
            assigned her to Shadow Moses on the same day that FOXHOUND would rebel, in order to blackmail him and that
            he was forced to hide vital information from Snake in order to ensure Meryl's safety. He apologized to
            Snake, saying that it was the least he could do for lying to him throughout the mission.</p>

          <p>However, before he could give any orders, in order to confuse the chain of command, Campbell was arrested
            by Jim Houseman, the Secretary of Defense. Houseman personally took over as the mission's commander and
            headed for Shadow Moses on an E-3C AWACS. Houseman assured Snake that the facility would be destroyed, along
            with him and his brother, both of whom he considered to be an embarrassment from the 1970s. When Snake
            accused him of setting up Donald Anderson and the other hostages, he expressed sorrow that Anderson had
            died, due to the fact Anderson was a friend of his. Houseman then offered to stop the bombing if Snake
            provided him with the REX battle data. Since Ocelot had stolen it during the torture session, Snake couldn't
            meet that demand.</p>

          <p>After Houseman signed off, Liquid demanded that the two fight. A grueling bare-handed fight then ensued
            between the "Twin Snakes," with Solid Snake eventually forcing Liquid over the side of REX’s head, to a long
            fall to the ground below. Snake immediately ran to check on Meryl who was fine. Otacon called and Snake
            demanded that he leave as soon as possible, warning him about the F-117 Nighthawk and B-2 Spirit stealth
            bombers that were on their way to nuke the base, but Otacon refused. He told Snake that he would rather stay
            where he was and help him and Meryl to escape, using his hacking talents to open any doors and passages for
            them.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Snake and Meryl escaped through the adjacent supply route and commandeered a jeep nearby. With Meryl
            driving, and Snake manning the rear machine gun, they broke through several barricades along the supply
            tunnel, eliminating the Genome Soldiers they encountered along the way. Shortly thereafter, Liquid, having
            survived his previous fall, appeared in another jeep, pursuing them whilst opening fire with a FAMAS assault
            rifle. Snake and Liquid exchanged fire, until the two jeeps reached the end of the tunnel, and crashed into
            one another in the confusion of the chase. Snake and Meryl were trapped under their overturned jeep, as
            Liquid slowly approached. However, before he could shoot Snake he began to suffer from a heart attack, as a
            result of FOXDIE. Snake, now convinced that he too would die, remained solemn.</p>

          <p>He then noticed that the stealth bombers weren't present, despite the fact that they should have arrived by
            then. Snake then received a call from Colonel Campbell who informed him that Jim Houseman had been arrested,
            since he had managed to contact the President and inform him of what had happened: Apparently, Houseman was
            acting alone with the entire event. He also revealed that the air strike orders had been rescinded and the
            six F-117s and B-2 bombers had returned to base, since Washington, D.C. was apparently not stupid enough to
            use nukes to cover up secrets (although Snake had some doubts about that).</p>

          <p>After learning that Meryl was alright, he again apologized to Snake for his behavior during the operation,
            though he also informed them that they were both now "officially dead," because their jeep "had crashed into
            the ocean." Snake requested a rescue for Otacon, and asked if he could speak to Naomi, who told Snake not to
            worry about FOXDIE and live his life as he would. Not afraid, Snake and Meryl rode off together into the
            Alaskan wilderness.</p>

          <p>After the incident, the only surviving member of FOXHOUND, Revolver Ocelot, reported the events to the
            President of the United States, since he had actually been working as a double agent in order to recover
            REX's data. He revealed that he had purposefully killed the DARPA Chief because he knew of Ocelot's true
            identity and motives. He also reported that the "inferior" twin, Solid Snake had defeated his brother
            Liquid, the latter of whom died believing himself to be the inferior one. Ocelot then complimented the
            President on being a "well balanced individual", worthy of ruling the world, as the perfect clone of Big
            Boss: Solidus Snake. He also, after inquiring the status of an unidentified female, was told to keep
            surveillance on her.</p>

          Aftermath
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>The U.S. Government denied any involvement in the Shadow Moses Incident and subsequently issued a cover
            story, which claimed that the revolt was the work of a radical right-wing group. According to this account,
            the incident was speedily resolved by the successful deployment of a commando unit, after rejecting the
            group's demands for the release of fellow members incarcerated in federal penitentiaries.</p>

          <p>As a consequence of sabotaging Snake's mission to Shadow Moses, Naomi Hunter was charged with treason and
            placed into a high-security federal prison. However, three weeks after the incident, Naomi managed to escape
            under mysterious circumstances. Nastasha Romanenko, doing her own independent research on the aftermath of
            the incident while preparing to expose the incident with the book In the Darkness of Shadow Moses: The
            Unofficial Truth, had discovered this and implied suspicion that it was Solid Snake who was responsible for
            engineering her escape, which resulted in Snake's rap sheet being modified to include this. In addition, the
            surviving Genome Soldiers (sans Johnny Sasaki) were reassigned to Pease AFB, officially for more training,
            although Romanenko suspected that they were actually imprisoned there to continue experimentation.</p>

          <p>Because Metal Gear REX's rail gun had undergone technical problems that required immediate attention prior
            to the terrorist takeover (hence why Baker entrusted the optical disc containing the REX data to Snake, and
            why Houseman had wanted the data badly), and the loss of the data to Ocelot, the REX project was cancelled.
            However, REX's data was later leaked worldwide by Ocelot, who had disappeared after the incident.</p>

          <p>Richard Ames was promoted to Colonel as a result of the mission, although the DIA, when Romanenko, Ames'
            ex-wife, called his office for his whereabouts, claimed that he never existed, causing Nastasha to falsely
            believe that he was killed for letting her escape.</p>

          <p>Campbell resumed retirement, although Meryl would eventually end up returning to the service due to her
            father's connections.</p>

          <p>Houseman's actions later resulted in his death supposedly by a self-inflicted gunshot, although Romanenko
            suspected due to witnessing his final actions late into the mission that the Patriots had arranged his death
            as he refused to "take the fall."</p>

          <p>Otacon resigned from ArmsTech and decided to visit relatives at England. He later formed Philanthropy with
            Solid Snake to take down the Metal Gear REX derivatives.</p>

          <p>Because the mission did not ultimately follow the Patriots' designs, the S3 Plan was developed specifically
            to resemble the mission, which eventually came to pass four years after the incident.</p>

          <p>George Sears was removed from the presidency by the Patriots, alongside nearly being killed by them before
            Ocelot intervened. The Patriots issued a cover story that claimed Sears resigned.</p>

          <p><strong>Liquid Snake</strong>, real name <strong>Eli</strong>, also known as <strong>White Mamba</strong>
            (Kikongo: "Nyoka ya Mpembe"), <strong>McDonell/Master Miller</strong>, or simply <strong>Liquid</strong>,
            was
            the leader of FOXHOUND during the Shadow Moses Incident. He was cloned from Big Boss's DNA as part of the
            Les
            Enfants Terribles project, along with his brothers Solid Snake and Solidus Snake. Liquid was led to believe
            that he had been created in order to express Big Boss's recessive genetic traits, and as such, was
            "inferior"
            to Solid Snake who supposedly had received Big Boss's dominant genes. Liquid therefore held a strong
            resentment towards Solid and wished to defeat him in combat, reclaiming what he felt was his birthright, and
            thus proving his superiority.</p>

          <p>Possessing an IQ of 180, Liquid spoke seven languages fluently, including English, Spanish, French, Malay,
            Arabic and Kikongo.[3][8] His main language, English, was also spoken with an English accent of the Received
            Pronunciation dialect during adulthood, and a Central London dialect during his childhood. He was almost an
            exact double of Solid Snake in terms of appearance, with the only distinguishable feature being his darker

            Оцелот),
            was a
            Russian-American operative of FOXHOUND and an agent of the Patriots. A master of interrogation and a
            formidable gunfighter, he
            was often referred to as a "ricochet genius" in regards to his gun fighting skills. A fanatic, he was known
            for his affinity towards Spaghetti Westerns, as evidenced by his choice of weapon and his clothing, duster
            and
            spurs, the traditional garb of cowboys. His weapon of choice was the Colt Single Action Army Revolver, which
            he regarded as "the greatest handgun ever made."</p>

            U.S.
            Special Forces Unit FOXHOUND.
            Originally a child soldier, Jaeger was the only operative in FOXHOUND to achieve the codename "Fox," the
            unit's highest commendation, and was decorated five times.</p>

          <p>Fox was Solid Snake's comrade-in-arms and friend during the Outer Heaven Uprising, but his loyalty to

            renegade commander Big Boss forced him into combat with Snake during the Zanzibar Land Disturbance. He
            survived his injuries following an intense battle, after which he was forcibly outfitted with a powered
            exoskeleton and subjected to intensive gene therapy. Fox later confronted Snake as a neutral force during
            the
            Shadow Moses Incident, in the guise of the Cyborg Ninja, before dying at the hands of Liquid Snake and Metal
            Gear REX.</p>
